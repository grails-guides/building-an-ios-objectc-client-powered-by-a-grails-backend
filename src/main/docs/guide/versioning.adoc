It is important to think about API versioning from the beginning, specially when you create an API
consumed by mobile phone applications. Users will run different versions of the app and you will need to version
your API to create advanced functionality but keep supporting legacy versions.

Grails allows multiple ways to http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/webServices.html#versioningResources[Version REST Resources].

* Using the URI
* Using the Accept-Version Header
* Using Hypermedia/Mime Types

In this guide we are going to version the API using the Accept-Version header.

Devices running version 1.0 will invoke the _announcements_ enpoint passing the 1.0 in the Accept Version Header.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -H "Accept-Version: 1.0" -X GET http://localhost:8080/announcements
----
Devices running version 2.0 will invoke the _announcements_ enpoint passing the 2.0 in the Accept Version Header.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -H "Accept-Version: 2.0" -X GET http://localhost:8080/announcements
