When the user taps an announcement, a _NSNotification_ is posted which contains
the tapped announcement. In the method _prepareForSegue:sender_ of _MasterViewController_
we set the announcement property of _DetailViewController_

To render the announcement we use a UILabel and UIWebView which we wire up to IBOutlets in the StoryBoard as illustrated below:
