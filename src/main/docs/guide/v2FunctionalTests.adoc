{sourceDir}

[source,groovy]
./src/integration-test/groovy/intranet/backend/AnnouncementControllerSpec.groovy

include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/intranet/backend/AnnouncementControllerSpec.groovy[indent=0,lines="1..15, 39..60, 99"]
----

<1> This annotation ensures serverPort contains the random port where the grails application started
<2> Body is not present in the JSON paylod

Grails command _test-app_ runs unit, integration and functional tests.
