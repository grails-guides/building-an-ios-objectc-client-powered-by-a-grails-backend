The next image illustrates the behavior of iOS app version 1.
The iOS app is composed by two View Controllers.

* When the iOS application initial screen loads, it requests an announcements list.
* The Grails app sends a JSON payload which includes a list of announcements. For each announcement a unique identifier, a title and a HTML body is included.
* The iOS app renders the JSON Payload in a _UITableView_
* The user taps an announcement's title and the app segues to a detail screen. The initial screen sends the
detail screen the announcement identiifer, title and HTML body.
The latter will be rendered in a _UIWebView_
