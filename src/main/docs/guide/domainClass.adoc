We need to create persistent entities to store company announcements. Grails handles persistence with the use of https://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Domain%20Classes/Usage.html[Grails Domain Classes]:

include::{commondir}/common-quoteDomainClass.adoc[]

Grails simplifies the creation of domain classes with the http://docs.grails.org/latest/ref/Command%20Line/create-domain-class.html[create-domain-class command].

Just to keep it simple, we assume the company announcements just contain a _title_ and a _HTML body_.
We are going to modify the domain class generated in the previous step to store that information.

.grails-app/domain/intranet/backend/Announcement.groovy

include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/intranet/backend/Announcement.groovy[indent=0,lines="1..16"]

<1> it enables us to store strings with more than 255 characters in the _body_.
