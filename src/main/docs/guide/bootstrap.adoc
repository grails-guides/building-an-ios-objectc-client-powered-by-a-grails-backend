We are going to populate the database with several announcements when the application startups.

In order to do that, we edit _grails-app/init/grails/company/intranet/BootStrap.groovy_.

[source,groovy]
----
package grails.company.intranet

class BootStrap {

    def init = { servletContext ->
        announcements().each { it.save() }
    }
    def destroy = {
    }

    static List<Announcement> announcements() {
        [
                new Announcement(title: 'Grails Quickcast #1: Grails Interceptors'),
                new Announcement(title: 'Grails Quickcast #2: JSON Views')
        ]
    }
}
----

NOTE: Announcements in the previous code snippet don't contain _body_ content
to keep the code sample small. Checkout `grails-app/init/intranet/backend/BootStrap.groovy` to see the complete code.
