To complete this guide you will need to checkout the source from Github and work through the steps presented by the guide.

To get started do the following:

* link:https://github.com/{githubSlug}/archive/master.zip[Download] and unzip the source or if you already have https://git-scm.com/[Git]: `git clone https://github.com/{githubSlug}.git`

### To follow the Grails part:

* `cd` into `{githubSlug}/initial`

Alternatively, if you already have Grails 3.2.4 installed then you can create a new application using the
following command in a Terminal window:

    $ grails create-app intranet.backend.grails-app --profile rest-api
    $ cd grails-app

When the create-app command completes, Grails will create a grails-app directory with an
application configured to create a REST application (due to the use of the parameter profile=rest-api )
and configured to use the hibernate feature with an H2 database.

TIP: You can go right to the completed Grails example if you `cd` into `{githubSlug}/complete`

### To follow the iOS part:

* `cd` into `{githubSlug}/initial-objectivec-ios`

* Head on over to the next section


Alternatively, you can create an iOS app using the New Project wizard of
Xcode Studio as illustrated in the next screenshots.

TIP: You can go right to the completed version 1 of the iOS example if you `cd` into `{githubSlug}/complete-objectivec-ios-v1`

TIP: You can go right to the completed version 2 of the iOS example if you `cd` into `{githubSlug}/complete-objectivec-ios-v2`
