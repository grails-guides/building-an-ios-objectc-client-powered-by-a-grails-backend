We are going to use create Controller for the domain class we previously created
and extend the http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/webServices.html#restfulControllers[RestfulController]. This
will provide us RESTful functionality to list, create, update and delete Announcement resources using
different HTTP  Methods.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/intranet/backend/v1/AnnouncementController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/intranet/backend/v1/AnnouncementController.groovy[indent=0,lines="1..13"]
----

<1> this controller will handle v1 of our api
<2> we want to respond only JSON Payloads

### Url Mapping

We want our endpoint to listen in /announcements instead of /announcement. Moreover, we want previous controller for
which we declared a namespace of v1 to handle the requests with the Accept-Version Http Header set to 1.0.

Grails enables powerful http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#urlmappingss[URL mapping] configuration to
do that. Add the next line to the mappings closure:

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/controllers/intranet/backend/UrlMappings.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/intranet/backend/UrlMappings.groovy[lines="13"]
