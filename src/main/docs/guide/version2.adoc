The problem with the first version of the API is that we include every announcement
body in the payload used to displayed the list. An announcement's body can be a large block of HTML.
A user will probably just wants to check a couple of announcements. It will save bandwidth and
make the app faster if we don't send the announcment body in the inital request. Instead we will ask
the api for a more complete announcement (including body) once the user taps the announcement.
